# DOSingleton

`DOSingleton` is a subclassable Objective-C singleton for Mac OSX and iOS.

## Ussage

### Copy files

Copy the following files to your project:

* `DOSingleton/DOSingleton.h`
* `DOSingleton/DOSingleton.m`

`DOSingleton` is also available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

### Subclass

`DOSingleton` is designed for subclassing, you should subclass it to make your own singleton:

``` objective-c
#import "DOSingleton.h"

@interface MySingleton : DOSingleton {
	NSString *foo;
}

- (void)printFoo;	

@end
```

When subclassing `DOSingleton` you should think about your subclass as an ordinary class, `DOSingleton` makes sure that there is only one instance of your class.
 
If you want to make your own initializer or override `-init` method your should check whether your singleton has already been initialized with `isInitialized` property to prevent repeated initialization.


``` objective-c
#import "MySingleton.h"
	
@implementation MySingleton
	
- (id)init
{
	self = [super init];
	if (self && !self.isInitialized) {
		foo = @"Foo";
	}
	return self;
}
	
- (void)printFoo
{
	NSLog(@"%@", foo);
}
	
@end
```

Then you can get the shared instance of your singleton with `+sharedInstance` methods:

``` objective-c
[[MySingleton sharedInstance] printFoo];
```
